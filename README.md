About the scripts for Uptake_home_page tests:
---------------------------------------------
- Have tried to incorporate around 7 test cases for the Uptake home page.
- Have implemented 4 test cases for page navigation and validation. 
- The tests are written using the Page Object Model pattern.
- Had written many other test cases for home_page on friday, but when I see it today(Monday) - many of the contents seems to have changed. Since the home page content is dynamic, I was able to write only few test cases(which is still good enough for the review - I believe, if still more needed - I can definitely write them and submit). I also have an approch to test these dynamic pages which keeps its contents changing every now and then.
